# Jewel1

This is a repository containing the data and source code used to generate the figures in the main text of "Jewel masks I: non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the guilt". 

## Quickstart

The requirements to run the code are:
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- scipy
- skimage
- astropy
- [dLux](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux)

The figure to script mapping is the following:
- Figure 5: `???` (also uses the image data from `data/`)
- Figure 6: `m_achromat_design.py`
